First: EDIT THE setup.cfg !


Then start a command line and change to this directory.


1) Compile the program. Use one of the following options:
    
    i) by default the multi-core prozessing option is enabled
    
        pip build -f
    

2) If no errors but only warnings have occured copy into packages folder:
    
    i) for current user only:
    
        pip install --user
    
    ii) for all users:
    
        pip install .


    iii) if you want to create an inplace module which only works in
         the local folder, you can use:
    
        pip install -e .
